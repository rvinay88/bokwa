Zumba is a fun way of doing a high impact cardio workout, so what is most imp is enjoying it, which makes strain and stress take a back seat, and before you realize, the one hour of jumping and jiving is done. For this,  one requires a good Zumba instructor like Senthil who can keep you in grip with the right kind of enjoyable steps coordinated with high calorie-burning.   Senthil sir's Zumba is full of life, smiles and the music, songs n steps changing every month, which doesn't make the routine boring. He himself is an ace Zumba sir, highly qualified in the art n makes his presence  in every class worthwhile! I am personally addicted to this workout because there is something new to look out for each month, it's fun, there's a lot of positive energy involved and a fun way to kickstart the day. 3 cheers to Senthil sir n his team
